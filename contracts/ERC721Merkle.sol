// QUESTION: Merkle trees are only cost effective for ~32 or fewer addressses as stated in GitHub Repo whats the other option for > 32?

// QUESTION: can we make those 2 constants a uint32 or something lower to save gas since we know the value and they are consts?
// QUESTION: token supply won't reach > 11 can we make that a lower uint as well? =>
// CONCLUSION: User will have to pay more because pulling a uint <256 from storage forces the evm to cast it to a uint256
// => cheaper at deployment but more expensive for the end user

// QUESTION: In the solidity course of Patrick Collins we learnt strings in solidity are basically an array so it's cheaper to make an if check
//           and return a custom error instead? Is it good practice or did something change in the last year / months?
// ANSWER:

// QUESTION: We also learnt the coding convention wirting storage variables with s as a prefix and private variables with _ as a prefix
//           and immutables with i as a prefix, is this still the "best practice"?
// ANSWER:

// QUESTION: about merkleProof did I do that right and put it as an inupt Param into constructor so the logic can happen off chain,
//           can we also move the merkleProof array offChain somehow in a database (later on obviously)?
// ANSWER:

// QUESTION: Can I handle both cases (presale & casual mint) in one function to save gas?
// ANSWER:

// QUESTION: Should I have adjusted the metadata which the NFT returns (_baseUri) to specify the seller_fee_basis_points (250 => 2.5%) & fee_recipient
//           which is needed on older nft market places like opensea to make those royalties availible there
